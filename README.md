# 🍻📊🌇 Iowa City Bar Survey 🌇📊🍻

The purpose of this project is to conduct a survey to collect data on which demographics like certain bars in Iowa City the most. Some of the demographics include gender, age, year in school, and others.

👉 For this assignment, I followed several best practices to make the survey user-friendly and accessible. Here are some of the things I did:

✔️ Used clear and concise labels for each input field, so users know exactly what information is being requested.

✔️ Used HTML5 input types, such as "number" and "email," to help ensure that users enter valid data.

✔️ Made the form mobile-friendly using responsive design. I used media queries in my stylesheet to adjust the layout and font size for smaller screens. This ensures that users can easily use and navigate the form on any device.

✔️ Used progressive disclosure in my form design by breaking up the survey into multiple pages. This helps prevent overwhelming users with too much information or too many input fields on a single page. I included a progress indicator so users can see how much of the survey is left and how far they've already progressed.

✔️ Used appropriate form validation techniques, such as HTML5 form validation attributes and JavaScript validation, to ensure that users enter valid data and don't encounter errors when submitting the form. This helps prevent frustration and errors, which can lead to users abandoning the form altogether.

🍺 Cheers to creating a user-friendly and accessible survey to better understand the demographics of the bar scene in Iowa City! 🍺
